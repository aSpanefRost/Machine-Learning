## The goal is to code a decision tree from scratch Just using Numpy,pandas,Seaborn and random libraries .The following document is the guideline for executing the sourcecode files: #
One should have python3 installed in his/her computer for the following commands to be excuted.
One can know Which version of python is in the computer by the following command:
```bash
python3 --version
```
for updating python one can use the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3.6
```
Also some libraries should be installed using the following commands:
```bash
pip3 install numpy                   #to install numpy
```
```bash
pip3 install pandas                 #to install pandas
```
```bash
pip3 install random2                #to install random
```
```bash
pip3 isntall seaborn                #to install seaborn
```
# Executing the files using terminal  #
# Files: #
 There are 3 files . One `.ipynb` files and two `.py` files . To execute the main file i.e the .ipynb one should install ipynb and the steps are given in the next block . 
 
 After installing ipynb , to execute the code in terminal you should first change your directory to the directory where you've saved the files . Then just simply you have type:
 ```bash
 ipython file_name.ipynb
 ```
 Otherwise if you want to run it on Jupyter then type the following command
 ```bash
 jupyter notebook --allow-root
 ```
 The .py functions only consists of function definitions and the functions are used in the .ipynb file
 One can simply execute the python files by the following command
 ```bash
 python file_name.py
 ```
 
 
# ipynb: #



A python package providing an easy way to explicitly import [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) files (`.ipynb`) the same way you would import regular `.py` files.

## Installation ##

You can install ipynb with:

```bash
pip3 install ipynb      
```
